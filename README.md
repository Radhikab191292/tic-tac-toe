Tic-tac-toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with X or O. The objective is to be the first to get three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. Players alternate placing their marks in an empty square, aiming to either complete their own row or block their opponent's. The game ends when a player achieves three in a row or all nine squares are filled without a winner, resulting in a draw. Tic-tac-toe is a simple yet strategic game, popular for its quick play and ease of learning.
